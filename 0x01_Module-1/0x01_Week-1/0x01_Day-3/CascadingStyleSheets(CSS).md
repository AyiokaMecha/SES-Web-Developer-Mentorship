## Tasks

### Task 1: Internal CSS

In this task, you will explore internal CSS by styling specific elements within your existing web page from Day 2. Follow these steps:

1. Open your `index.html` file from Day 2, where you displayed cat information.

2. Within the `<head>` section of your HTML file, create a `<style>` element. This is where you'll define your internal CSS rules.

3. Now, use internal CSS to style specific elements on your page. For example, you can change the:
   - Font color of headings and paragraphs to a consistent color. You can use `#333333` for a dark gray.
   - Background color of specific sections to provide contrast. Consider using `#f0f0f0` for a light gray background.
   - Text size and alignment of your cat descriptions. You can set the font size to `16px` and align text to `left`.

```html
<style>
  h1, h2, p {
    color: #333333;
  }

  .section-background {
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
  }

  .cat-description {
    font-size: 16px;
    text-align: left;
  }
</style>
```

4. Test your web page in a browser to see how the internal CSS affects the visual appearance. Observe the changes you've made and how they enhance the overall look and feel of your page.

### Task 2: External CSS

In this task, you will create a dedicated external CSS file to style your web page. Follow these steps:

1. Create a new file named `styles.css` in the same directory as your `index.html` file.

2. Open the `styles.css` file, and this is where you'll define your CSS rules to style your web page elements.

3. Link the `styles.css` file to your `index.html` file using an external link in the `<head>` section. This establishes a connection between your HTML file and the external CSS file.

4. Apply styles to various elements on your web page using the external CSS file. You can target elements by their HTML tags, classes, or IDs. For example, you can:
   - Change the font family and size for all headings to `Arial, sans-serif` and `24px`.
   - Define a consistent color palette for your entire page. Use `#007acc` for links and `#333333` for text.
   - Adjust the margins and padding of sections for better layout.

```html
/* styles.css */
h1, h2, p {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  font-size: 24px;
  color: #333333;
}

a {
  color: #007acc;
}

.section-margin {
  margin: 20px;
}

.section-padding {
  padding: 10px;
}
```

5. Test your web page to observe the changes made by the external CSS. Notice how the styles defined in the external CSS file impact the appearance of your page.

### Task 3: In-line CSS

In this task, you will experiment with in-line CSS by applying styles directly within specific HTML elements. Follow these steps:

1. Choose a specific element on your web page to style (e.g., an image or a paragraph).

2. Within that element's HTML tag, use the `style` attribute to apply in-line CSS styles directly. For instance, you can:
   - Set a unique background color for an image, such as `background-color: #ffcc00;`.
   - Change the text color and font size for a specific paragraph. Use `color: #990000;` and `font-size: 18px;`.
   - Adjust the border and padding of a particular section. For example, `border: 1px solid #999999;` and `padding: 15px;`.

```html
<!-- Example for in-line CSS -->
<img src="cat.jpg" alt="A cute cat" style="background-color: #ffcc00;">

<p style="color: #990000; font-size: 18px;">This cat breed is known for its playful nature.</p>

<div style="border: 1px solid #999999; padding: 15px;">
  <!-- Content here -->
</div>
```

3. Experiment with different CSS properties and values to change the appearance of the chosen element.

4. Test your web page to see how the in-line CSS affects the selected element. Observe how the styles applied in-line override any external or internal CSS styles for that particular element.

By completing these tasks, you will gain a deeper understanding of CSS and its various application methods. You'll also witness firsthand how CSS can transform the look and feel of your web pages.
