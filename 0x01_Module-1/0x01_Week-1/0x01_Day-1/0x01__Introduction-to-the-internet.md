Certainly, here's an updated set of tasks that guide students to use GitHub to create a repository and write their blog using Markdown:

**Tasks:**

1. **Introduction to Markdown:**
   - Begin by learning about Markdown, a lightweight markup language used for formatting text on platforms like GitHub.
   - Explore this [GitHub Markdown Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to understand the basics of Markdown syntax.
   - Experiment with creating headers, lists, links, and emphasis in Markdown in a text editor of your choice.

2. **Create a GitHub Repository:**
   - Log in to your GitHub account or create one if you don't have it yet.
   - Create a new GitHub repository to host your blog post. Give it the name, ```SES-Web-mentorship```
   - Create a new folder. Give it the name, ```0x01_Introduction-to-the-internet```
   - Create a new file. Give it the name, ```Introduction-to-the-internet.md```

3. **Write Your Blog in Markdown:**
   - Using the Markdown syntax you've learned, write your blog post directly in the README.md file of your repository.
   - Include the key points and insights you gained from Day 1 of the Web Mentorship Program. Structure your blog post with headings, lists, and links for clarity.
   - Don't forget to add a captivating title and an introductory paragraph.

4. **Commit and Push to GitHub:**
   - Once you've written your blog post in Markdown, commit your changes to your local repository.
   - Push your local repository to GitHub to make your blog post accessible on the web.

5. **Share Your GitHub Repository:**
   - Share the link to your GitHub repository with your peers or on social media, inviting others to read your blog post.
   - Encourage feedback and comments on your GitHub repository.

6. **Additional Challenge (Optional):**
   - Explore advanced Markdown features like tables, images, and code blocks to enhance your blog post.
   - Consider using GitHub's features like issues and pull requests for collaboration with peers who may want to contribute to your blog or provide feedback.

By following these tasks, you'll not only create a blog post about your Day 1 learnings but also gain valuable experience using Markdown and GitHub. This practical exercise aligns with real-world practices in web development and version control, setting a strong foundation for your journey in the Web Mentorship Program.
