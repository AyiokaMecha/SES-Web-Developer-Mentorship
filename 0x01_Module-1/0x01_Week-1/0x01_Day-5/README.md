### Task 1: Adding Bootstrap to Your Web Page

1. Open your text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).

2. Create a new HTML file named `index-bootstrap.html`.

3. Include the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files by adding the following code within the `<head>` section of your HTML file:

```html
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.0-beta1/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.0-beta1/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
```

4. Within the `<body>` section of your HTML file, use Bootstrap classes to style the existing elements in your web page. For example, you can use the `container` class to create a responsive container, and the `btn` class to style buttons.
