# Introduction to the internet

The internet is mindblowing and it is such a shame that most of us don't know and may never get to know the 
magic behind this useful tool that I consider as the culmination of all the enginuity of the human brain.
The internet is simple really and it operates on the following 4 principles:
1. The client and the server
   - The client is you, well not you exactly but the computer and/or device that you use to access anything over the internet
   - the server is a computer just like yours but one that has higher operating power than yours and is capable of storing a lot of data that you access, think about all of the video you've watched they aren't in you device's storage but in the server's storage
     The interaction between the server and the client is enable by, drumrolls please, the internet
2. The internet consist of the following:
   - The internet service provider who gives you the client access to the internet. P.S you are not connected directly to the internet only severs do that you are connect to it via an ISP, the guy you buy internet bundles form, gerrit.
   - The infrastructure that enables the data transfer be it fibre optic cables, Wi-Fi and all the rest you can think about
   - The communication protocols agreed upon by numeroous organisations to be used in the internet to ensure that the data is transmitted safely

This is a rough draft that I'll perfect over the course of the module!!!
